# Trust scoring and ranking service
**ServiceID**: trust-service

Trust computation service in the NIMBLE Microservice Infrastructure.

A prototype implementation of a NIMBLE trust computation service. The service computes a trust score for NIMBLE entities (e.g. providers/sellers) by evaluating their trust-related characteristics in regards to the trust expectations (trust policy defined by a platform manager) 

## Development

Micro-service implementation using the Spring Boot framework and Java language.
  
## Configuration

Base configuration can be found at src/main/resources/application.properties and bootstrap.yml.
[Spring Cloud Config](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/) is used for central configuration management. A central configuration is hosted on [https://github.com/nimble-platform/cloud-config](https://github.com/nimble-platform/cloud-config)
and injected during startup.

For database configuration, Hibernate will create the database schema using JPA settings from bootstrap.yml and application.properties.
However, before Hibernate creates the schema, the database (Postgres) must be installed and  bootstrap.yml configured with the database connection details.

After trust-service is started and database schema created please execute the ```/sql/initialConfig.sql``` 


## Swagger

The Trust Scoring and Ranking API is designed using the [swagger.io editor](http://editor.swagger.io) (file: src/main/resources/api.yml) and the code generator for the Spring framework. 
The Maven plugin (swagger-codegen-maven-plugin) is used to generate defined interfaces automatically in each Maven build.

## How-to

### Service build and startup

#### local (non-cloud)
 ```
 mvn clean spring-boot:run
 ```
 
#### docker (cloud)
 It will be possible to run the service in docker environment from core cloud infrastructure, but this part is still under configuration.
 
 Start the local example setup with
 
 ```bash
 docker-compose up
 ```
 
### Get Version Request
